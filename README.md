# terminal search command
This Project is for discussion of developing a terminal command for finding all the files based on a string pattern (ultimately).
<details>
	<summary>Goals</summary>

	1. To mimic what dbt-power-user VS code extension can do.
	i.e., being able to find parent and child models based on the current model

	2. When not searching for models, this command can give back all the files
	containing a string pattern within a (dbt project) repo
